# Case Studies

## Startup Regression Suite from 0 Tests to a Comprehensive Automated UI Suite
- **Context:** Manual-heavy regressions and an overseas team blocked weekly releases.
- **Work:** Built lean nose+Selenium suite to cover most UI test cases.
- **Outcome:** Faster regression, higher release cadence.

## UI Test Suite for a Chat App
- **Context:** Current UI tests did not account for a server/client browser setup. 
- **Work:** Standard Python framework, engineered a test framework with separate browser sessions to better model test cases.
- **Outcome:** Consistent results, better automation coverage of complex test cases.
